## Latest Fix: Universal Gene ID Support for Network Visualization âœ… COMPLETED

### Problem Identified

- Users inputting UniProt IDs (or other non-Entrez ID types) could not see their genes highlighted in pathway networks
- Gene matching was failing because KEGG pathways internally use Entrez IDs, but highlighting was attempted using original input IDs
- Network visualization showed "none of the genes were found" even when genes were actually present in the pathway

### Solution Implemented

1. **Early ID Conversion System**:
   - All input gene IDs are now converted to Entrez IDs immediately after loading
   - Both original IDs and converted Entrez IDs are stored in reactive values
   - `converted_entrez_genes()` reactive value stores Entrez IDs for KEGG operations

2. **Enhanced Gene Highlighting**:
   - Updated `apply_gene_highlighting()` function to prioritize Entrez ID matching
   - Gene highlighting now uses converted Entrez IDs instead of original input IDs
   - Added multi-level matching: Entrez IDs â†’ HGNC symbols â†’ node labels (fallback)

3. **Improved Gene Pathway Matching**:
   - `genes_in_pathway` output now uses Entrez ID matching for reliable gene detection
   - Shows which genes were found via Entrez ID conversion vs traditional matching
   - Better error messages when genes aren't found, with conversion rate information

4. **Enhanced User Feedback**:
   - Gene statistics display shows conversion rates for non-Entrez ID inputs
   - Validation results clearly indicate how many genes are "KEGG-ready"
   - Instructions updated to mention automatic conversion to Entrez IDs

5. **Optimized Enrichment Analysis**:
   - KEGG enrichment now directly uses converted Entrez IDs for better performance
   - Eliminates redundant ID conversion during enrichment analysis

## Latest Enhancement: Comprehensive Selected Gene Card Display âœ… COMPLETED

### Issues Addressed

1. **Gene Symbol Display Issue**: Selected gene cards were showing Entrez IDs (numbers) instead of readable gene symbols, even though network nodes displayed symbols
2. **Reduced Functionality**: The comprehensive gene information display from the original implementation was simplified and missing key features

### New Features Implemented

1. **Comprehensive Gene ID Display**:
   - Shows all available gene ID types (Symbol, Entrez, Ensembl, UniProt, KEGG)
   - Dynamically pulls from the comprehensive gene mapping database
   - Fallback handling when comprehensive mapping is not available
   - Clear section organization with "GENE IDENTIFIERS" header

2. **Enhanced UniProt Information**:
   - Displays protein names and aliases when available
   - Shows comprehensive mapping information beyond just IDs
   - Maintains 3D structure links for protein visualization
   - Better error handling for missing UniProt data

3. **Improved Relationship Display**:
   - Relationship connections now prefer gene symbols over IDs for readability
   - Smart fallback: Symbol â†’ Label â†’ ID for connection display
   - Maintains all relationship types (incoming/outgoing connections)
   - Shows relationship subtypes and detailed connection information

4. **User-Friendly Display Priority**:
   - Primary display uses gene symbols instead of Entrez IDs when available
   - Comprehensive ID mapping shown in organized sections
   - Clear visual hierarchy with distinct sections
   - Maintains backward compatibility with existing functionality

### Technical Implementation

- **Enhanced Node Selection Handler**: Complete rewrite of the `observe` block for pathway network selection
- **Comprehensive Mapping Integration**: Uses the `comprehensive_mapping` reactive value loaded at startup
- **Smart ID Resolution**: Automatically resolves the best display names for each gene
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks when mapping data is unavailable
- **Performance Optimized**: Efficient lookups using pre-loaded mapping data

### User Experience Improvements

- âœ… **Readable Gene Names**: Selected gene cards now show symbols (e.g., "TP53") instead of numbers (e.g., "7157")
- âœ… **Complete ID Coverage**: Display all relevant gene ID types in one place
- âœ… **Comprehensive Information**: Restored full functionality with enhanced data sources
- âœ… **Better Navigation**: Clear sections and organized information hierarchy
- âœ… **Consistent Experience**: Network labels and selected gene cards now use consistent naming

### Technical Files Updated

- `server.R`: Enhanced node selection observer with comprehensive gene ID display and improved relationship handling

## Bug Fix: Node Selection Error Resolution âœ… FIXED

### Issue Details

- Error when clicking on gene nodes in pathway networks: "missing value where TRUE/FALSE needed"
- Error occurred in `renderUI` function at line 817 in server.R
- Issue was caused by `!is.na()` checks on potentially NULL values

### Root Cause

- When accessing columns that don't exist in data frames (e.g., `uniprot_info$name` or `gene_record$alias_symbol`), R returns `NULL`
- Using `!is.na(NULL)` causes the error because `is.na()` expects a vector, not NULL
- The comprehensive gene mapping data structure varies, and some columns might not exist

### Fix Applied

- **Enhanced NULL Checking**: Added `!is.null()` checks before all `!is.na()` conditions
- **Safe Column Access**: All data frame column access now follows the pattern: `!is.null(df$col) && !is.na(df$col) && df$col != ""`
- **Comprehensive Error Prevention**: Fixed all instances in gene ID display, UniProt information, and relationship display sections

### Fixed Code Sections

1. **Gene ID Information Display**: Safe access to `hgnc_symbol`, `entrezgene_id`, `ensembl_gene_id`, `uniprotswissprot`
2. **UniProt Information Section**: Safe access to `name`, `alias_symbol`, and other protein attributes
3. **Relationship Display**: Safe access to `hgnc_symbol` and `label` in source/target nodes
4. **Fallback Information**: Safe handling of gene symbol display

### Technical Details

**Before (causing error):**

```r
if (!is.na(gene_record$name) && gene_record$name != "")
```

**After (error-free):**

```r
if (!is.null(gene_record$name) && !is.na(gene_record$name) && gene_record$name != "")
```

### Benefits for Users

Users can now click on any gene node in pathway networks and see:

- **All Gene ID Types**: Symbol, Entrez, Ensembl, UniProt, and KEGG IDs in one place
- **Readable Names**: Gene symbols prominently displayed instead of numeric IDs
- **Complete Information**: Protein information, aliases, and comprehensive mapping data
- **Clear Relationships**: Connection information using readable gene names
- **Consistent Interface**: Gene names match between network display and information cards

### New Benefits

- âœ… **Universal ID Support**: Users can input any supported ID type and see genes highlighted
- âœ… **Reliable Matching**: Uses Entrez IDs for consistent gene detection in KEGG pathways  
- âœ… **Better UX**: Clear feedback about conversion success rates and gene availability
- âœ… **Performance**: Eliminates redundant ID conversions during analysis
- âœ… **Backward Compatibility**: Still supports traditional gene symbol matching as fallback

### Additional Files Modified

- `server.R`: Added `converted_entrez_genes` reactive, enhanced gene loading, improved UI feedback
- `R/kegg_utils.R`: Updated `apply_gene_highlighting()` for Entrez ID priority matching
- `R/enrichment_utils.R`: Already had robust ID conversion functions (no changes needed)

### User Impact
